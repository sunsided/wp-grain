Grain Theme for WordPress
-------------------------

* You can find Grain at: 
  http://wp-grain.wiki.sourceforge.net/

* You can download newest releases at:
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=228008



1) Installation prerequisites

* Get and install YAPB (http://johannes.jarolim.com/yapb)
  The Grain theme won't work without the YAPB plugin. 
  You will find installation  instructions on the YAPB website.


2) Installation instructions

* Extract the archives's contents into the wp-content/themes 
  directory of your WordPress installation.
  If you are updating from a version prior to 0.2, please consider
  removing all old files first - at least the .css files - since 
  you would end up with a bunch of abandoned files otherwise.

3) Configuration

* See the Wiki at http://wp-grain.wiki.sourceforge.net/Installation
  for more information about the configuration options.

4) Have fun.
   ;)
